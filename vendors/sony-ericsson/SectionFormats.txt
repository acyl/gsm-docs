Entries in the above table marked with a * are deleted entries. If the deleted entries in the table are sorted 
on their second byte:
			8C 00 00 00 00	 83 14 00 00 8C	 8B 15 00 00 8C	 80 18 00 00 8B	 8B 1B 00 00 8B

			80 4B 00 00 80

It can be seen that all the gaps but one can be filled in the sorted version of the msg/pdu offsets part of the
section table. The missing value is 57 which can be found at 0ffset 0x0006 in the section table. This value and 
the value at offset 0x0008 are used when deleting a msg.

Changes to umrt and section table when a msg is deleted.
========================================================

When a received msg is selected for deletion several changes have to be made to both the umrt and the section table.

In the section table above two references are marked with an 'x':
01 31 2F 00 00x - reference to an sms pdu header.
01 48 38 00 00x - reference to a (read) received msg header.

If this message is deleted then the new umrt will be:

There are now gaps at 14, 15, 18, 1B, 2F, 34, 3B, 48, 4B, 4E, 51, 54 and 57 i.e. there are two new
gaps at 51 and 54

Entries in the above table marked with a * are deleted entries. If the deleted entries in the table are sorted 
on their second byte:

8C 00 00 00 00
83 14 00 00 8C
8B 15 00 00 8C
80 18 00 00 8B

81 4E 00 00 80
81 51 00 00 81*
81 57 00 00 81*

Differences
-----------
1.	The size of the umrt was reduced by 8 bytes - two used refs have been removed (51 and 54).

2.	The number of long vals has been decreased to 0x4C.

3.	The reference to the sms pdu header in the section table - 01 31 2F 00 00 - has been replaced 
	with 81 57 00 00 81.
	The 57 is the value at offset 0x0006 in the previous verson of the section table.
	The 81's are produced by ORing 01 and 00 with the byte at offset 0x0009 in the previous version 
	of the section table.

4.	The reference to the received msg header in the section table - 01 48 38 00 00 - has been replaced 
	with 81 51 00 00 81.
	The 51 is the first byte of the last entry in the old version of the umrt.
	The 81's are produced by ORing 01 and 00 with the byte at offset 0x0009 in the previous version 
	of the section table.

5.	The new value at offset 0x0006 in the section table is 54. This is the first byte of last but one 
	entry in the previous version of the umrt.

NOTE: 	Differences 4 & 5 have changed. When this was last looked at the umrt entries used where the first 
-----	and second. (Possibly changes on a daily basis... like channel numbers used by the by vcard server.)
