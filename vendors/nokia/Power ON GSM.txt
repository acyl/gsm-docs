Temat: Power ON GSM
      Hello,

      One week ago, i asked if there was a way to Power ON the GSM using FBUS.
      Now, I found it and I want to inform you how to do because I think it could be interesting for some people in the list who wanted to know it.

      I discover that GSM ignores messages on the Bus when he's powered off AND its battery charger is not connected.
      So, to power ON the GSM when it's off, you'll need to  put an external voltage on the GSM and simply send  a request for a reset (Hard or soft give the same results in this case).
      See the Gnokii source for the reset function.

      Thank you all for your support, specially Marcin who answer my question.

      Valérian
