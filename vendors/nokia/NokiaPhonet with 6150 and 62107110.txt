Temat: Nokia:Phonet with 6150 and 6210/7110

I have been able to communicate with my 6150 (v5.02) using
infrared with Nokia:Phonet/IrLMP (by method of trial and error
and some luck). I'd like to share this with you with some questions
of my own. The packet is:

14         // Frame ID
7f 0c      // Dest/Src, 7f=broadcast?
d1         // Mesg type
00 05      // LenHi, LenLo
00 01 00   // Header
03 00      // Subtype, data

The phone responds with a d2 mesg. The phone also periodically
sends 0a/71 messages.

If I put 0x00 in the dest, the phone just echoes it back to me.
Also, I have tried other commands but the phone (6150) does not
seem recognize them (also echoes back).

Now for my question:
I have tried this with a 6210 (v 4.08) and it does not respond
at all! What is the difference with 6150 and 6210 with regard
to Phonet? Thanks in advance.
